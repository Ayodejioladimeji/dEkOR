## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 20.x)
- Yarn (>= 1.x)

## Installation

## Code Quality and Linting

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and formatting. Husky is used to enforce commit message guidelines.

1. **Run ESLint to check for errors:**

    ```bash
    yarn lint
    ```

2. **Automatically fix fixable ESLint errors:**

    ```bash
    yarn lint:fix
    ```

    ```bash
    yarn format
    ```

## Commit Guidelines

We follow specific commit message guidelines to ensure clear and concise commit history.

- Commit messages should be descriptive and meaningful.
- Each commit should relate to a single task or issue.

Husky will check your commit messages against our guidelines when you try to commit. Make sure your commit message follows the specified format.
